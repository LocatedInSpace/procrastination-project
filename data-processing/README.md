First use split-into-sessions for a participant-*_desktop_info, then run turn-to-csv.py on each of the resulting files.

It expects all the produced files to be in the same directory, and also that you have desktop-notifications for the participant-*_desktop_info files.

Basically, move all the files from central-server into this directory.
